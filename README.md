## Introduction
In this project, I leverage time series forecasting techniques to predict hourly energy consumption for various states in the US. By analyzing historical energy consumption data and other relevant factors, my goal is to develop accurate forecasting models that can assist energy providers and policymakers in making informed decisions regarding energy production and distribution.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of hourly energy consumption data for multiple states for a regional transmission organization (RTO) in the United States. It is part of the Eastern Interconnection grid operating an electric transmission system serving all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

The hourly power consumption data comes from PJM's website and are in megawatts (MW).
